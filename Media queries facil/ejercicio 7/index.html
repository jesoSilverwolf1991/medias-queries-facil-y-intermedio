        In a dead end street in Tokyo
        Finished my bottle all alone
        Where I'll end up well I just don't know
        Another dead end in Tokyo
        
        There's a thousand glowing street signs all in a row
        And there's a rich man toasting to the people below
        He's just standing at his window sipping Dom Perignon
        Because he feels like the king of Kabuki-Cho Who oh oh
    </p>
